              No, they are not! Everyone needs help at some point in their life. You have the strength that you’ve used before, that for whatever reason isn’t working right now.

Additionally, therapy is completely confidential. You won’t have to hear about others “knowing my business. “In therapy, you are in a safe environment.

              If you are concerned about your relationship, and you would both like to work with me, I would initially work with both of you together.
